# Best Coffee in Munich

For the last few years, I am keeping a personal list for the cafes I often visit. I often try to see the cafes that have the claim to make a good coffee. This list is my personal ranking amongs them.

## Tips

- Most of the cafes in the list offer two selections of beans. The chocolate/nutty ones are mostly their regular blend and the other one changes on weekly/bi-weekly basis. Go for the changing ones as they're typically more exotic.
- Most of them are also closed on Sundays. If it's Sunday â†’ just go to Bla.

1. **Cafe Bla:**
   - Best espresso based.
   - Ask for "split shot" where they pull a double shot in two cups and make macchiato with one. You may taste the bean with/without milk with one order.
   - They don't do v60 on the weekends. but the batch brew is also quite nice. Update 2025: they bought marco sp9 machines for filter. They don't do handbrew anymore but the machines make quite high quality filter.
   - Ambiance also +

2. **Sweet Spot: (Marienplatz)**
   - Don't try to go in the weekend. Very small. But it's worth it if you can find a place.
   - The coffee is top quality. I never really tried pour-over I think they don't even offer it.

3. **Vits:**
   - Hand brew has tons of variations. Strong recommend for filter.
   - Spacious.
   - Espresso don't have the same selections.

4. **Standl 20:**
   - Strong recommend in the summer. They don't have super special beans, but the baristas were always skillful and nice to talk.
   - Recommend: Cortado, or flat-white.

5. **Man vs. Machine:**
   - Their house blend is quite nice.
   - They also have Syphon it's very cool to watch it while it's being made :)
   - I buy the beans I use at home from them most of the times

6. **Roca Junior:**
   - Only went twice. And tried different stuff. I need to try the usual drinks as well.
   - Nice summer drinks. (Espresso & Tonic is ðŸ”¥)

7. **Calima**:
   - A nice cafe to sit and talk with friends.
   - Both the espresso based, and filter are successful.

8. **Suuapinga:**
   - Has three branches. BlutenburgStrasse one is the best imo. But they all have some standards
   - Coffee is specialty. Was a bit of hit or miss for me but they change the beans weekly.

9. **Sois Blessed:**
   - It's actually a clothing store. But they have high quality coffee as well
   - The cafe has a premium feeling, coffee is good but not amazing.

10. **Alrighty Roastery:**
    - A big roastery near ostbahnof. They have a cafe section as well.
    - Has an industrial look. Not cozy but cool to try out.
    - Good flat white. Good filter.
    - They have good but overpriced baklava for some reason

11. **Amulet Cafe:**
    - A new small shop. The owner is Turkish :)

12. **Peet and the Flat white:**
    - Good coffee (espresso based), small place.
    - Update 2025: They changed place for a bigger one where they also serve food. Coffee was still done the same but I didn't like the atmosphere that much.
